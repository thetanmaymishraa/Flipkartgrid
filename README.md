# Flipkartgrid

Welcome to the **Flipkartgrid** repository! This project is centered around object identification and counting using a combination of machine learning models, Arduino setups, and OpenCV. Our aim is to build an efficient system that can not only detect objects but also assess the freshness of vegetables and fruits.

### 🛠️ Key Scripts for Analysis

The following Python scripts are included for various functionalities in this project:

1. **`predict.py`**  
   This script runs the predictions based on the trained model provided. It identifies objects and returns relevant outputs.

2. **`freshness_analysis.py`**  
   Responsible for evaluating the freshness of fruits and vegetables by analyzing the hue index and other visual characteristics.

3. **`ocr2txt.py`**  
   Extracts text information through OCR, facilitating the collection of key data from images or other media.

4. **`model.py`**  
   Integrates the trained model (available via Google Drive) for use in predictions and freshness analysis.

### 🚀 Future Development

**Our next steps involve integrating the Arduino setup with the machine learning model and OpenCV**, allowing for real-time object detection and counting. This integration will enhance the overall system's functionality, bringing us closer to our goal of creating an automated, intelligent detection system.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate!
