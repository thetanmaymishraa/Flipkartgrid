# Flipkartgrid

Welcome to the repository for **Flipkartgrid**! This project focuses on identifying and counting objects using machine learning models, Arduino setups, and OpenCV integration.

### ðŸ“‚ Files and Resources
Here you'll find the files we've created along with links to important resources:

- ðŸ”— **[Trained Model for Freshness Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B4VwIgL_T5oYj-Axd4Tt1YuweKVbGu5u/view?usp=sharing)**  
   This model is used to determine the freshness of vegetables. We've trained it specifically for our object detection task.
  
- ðŸ”— **[Arduino Setup on TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jkKLdBzNSdx-object-detection-and-count-display?sharecode=pwNw3peG_1nD_JYhx19vs2V0MFfaQlcoGzbjLYGbA-E)**  
   This link takes you to our Arduino setup implemented on TinkerCAD, where we simulate object detection and display counts using an Arduino.

### ðŸš€ Future Plans

**We are working towards integrating this Arduino setup with the machine learning model and OpenCV** to create a complete system that not only detects but also counts objects in real-time.

Stay tuned for more updates!
